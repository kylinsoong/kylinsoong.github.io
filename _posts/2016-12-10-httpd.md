## Configuring Apache HTTPD

### Apache HTTPD 简介

Apache HTTPD is one of the most used web servers on the Internet. A web server is a daemon that speaks the **http(s)** protocol, a text-based protocol for sending and receiving objects over a network connection. The **http** protocol is sent over the wire in clear text, using port **80/TCP** by default (though other ports can be used). There is also a TLS/SSL encrypted version of the protocol called **https** that uses port **443/TCP** by default.

### Installing

~~~
yum -y install httpd httpd-manual
~~~

### Configuring

Configuration file and root directory:

* `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf` - default configuration
* `/var/www/html` - default directory for all requests 

Network security

* `firewalld` has two predefined services for httpd

~~~
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http --add-service=https
firewall-cmd  --reload
~~~

* to check SELinux allowed port sets

~~~
semanage port -l | grep '^http_'
~~~

* Add a SELinux rule to allow use an alternate document root

~~~
semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_content_t '/new/location(/.*)?'
~~~

* Create a test page

Create the `/var/www/html/index.html` file and any content.

### Start and enable

~~~
systemctl start httpd.service
systemctl enable httpd.service
~~~

### Testing

Open a web browse access the following 2 urls:

* http://localhost
* http://localhost/manual

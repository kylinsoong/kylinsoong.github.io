### What does Analytics Platform mean? 

An analytics platform is a unified and proper solution designed to address the demands of users, especially large data-driven companies, on the inadequacy of relational database management systems (RDBMS) in providing contextual analyzed data out of all the stored information. It joins different tools for creating analytics systems together with an engine to execute, a DBMS to store and manage the data, data mining processes, and techniques and mechanisms for obtaining and preparing data that is not stored. This solution can be conveyed as a software-only application or as a cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) provided to organizations in need of contextual information that all their data points to, in other words, analytical information based on current data records.

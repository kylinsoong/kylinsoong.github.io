## Materialized Views

Teiid Materialized views are just like other views, but their transformations are pre-computed and stored just like a regular table. When queries are issued against the views through the Teiid Server, the cached results are used.

There are 2 categories of Materialization:

* External Materialization - External materialized views cache their data in an external database system. External materialized views give the administrator full control over the loading and refresh strategies.
* Internal Materialization - Internal materialization creates Teiid temporary tables to hold the materialized table. While these tables are not fully durable, they perform well in most circumstances and the data is present at each Teiid instance which removes the single point of failure and network overhead of an external database. Internal materialization also provides more built-in facilities for refreshing and monitoring. 

Detailed documentation from [Teiid doc](https://teiid.gitbooks.io/documents/content/caching/Materialized_Views.html).

## Internal Materialization

An Internal Materialization have to meet the following 3 conditions:

1. the view should be VIRTUAL, which means the View should be in a `VIRTUAL` model
2. `materialized` have to be set and value should be true
3. `teiid_rel:ALLOW_MATVIEW_MANAGEMENT` should be added and value should be true

### Update Strategies in VDB Deployment

The MaterializationManager FinishDeployment judge Materialized View is Internal by `MATERIALIZED_TABLE` option, if `MATERIALIZED_TABLE` is set, the Materialized View is Internal.

The Update Strategies controled by `teiid_rel:MATVIEW_TTL` option:

* If `teiid_rel:MATVIEW_TTL` is set, a Scheduled ExecutorService will be triggered, which execute SYSADMIN.refreshMatView() repeatedly with a specified TTL interval  
* If `teiid_rel:MATVIEW_TTL` is not set or less than/equals 0, the Materialized View be load only one time

**MaterializationAction process**

**Appendix-1**
 
1. If MATERIALIZED_TABLE is not configured, the View is Internal
2. If teiid_rel:MATVIEW_TTL is not configured, or value <= 0, sql `select count(*) from MatView` pass to executeAsynchQuery(), and execute once.
3. If teiid_rel:MATVIEW_TTL is configured and value > 0, sql `call SYSADMIN.refreshMatView('MatView', true)` pass to executeAsynchQuery(), and execute repeatedly

**Appendix-2**

[DQPCore Execute Request](http://ksoong.org/teiid-s-diagram/#dqpcore-execute-request)

> NOTE: 2 kinds of probable SQL will be passed to this method, `select count(*) from MatView` or `call SYSADMIN.refreshMatView('MatView', true)`

### The MatViews Table

[SYSADMIN.MatViews](https://teiid.gitbooks.io/documents/content/reference/sysadmin_schema.html#_sysadmin_matviews) supplies information about all the materailized views in the virtual database. It's creation SQL looks

~~~
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE MatViews (
        VDBName string(255) NOT NULL,
        SchemaName string(255) NOT NULL,
        Name string(255) NOT NULL,
        TargetSchemaName string(255),
        TargetName string,
        Valid boolean,
        LoadState string(255),
        Updated timestamp,
        Cardinality integer,
        PRIMARY KEY (VDBName, SchemaName, Name)
);
~~~

[SYSADMIN.MatViews](https://teiid.gitbooks.io/documents/content/reference/sysadmin_schema.html#_sysadmin_matviews) is a system tables, in this section we will look how System tables be queries in Teiid.

### A sample Dynamic VDB defining an internal materialization

~~~
<model name="StocksMatModel" type="VIRTUAL">
    <metadata type="DDL"><![CDATA[
        CREATE view stockPricesInterMatView
                (
            product_id integer,
            symbol string,
            price bigdecimal,
            company_name   varchar(256)
                ) OPTIONS (materialized true,         
               "teiid_rel:ALLOW_MATVIEW_MANAGEMENT" 'true', 
               "teiid_rel:MATVIEW_PREFER_MEMEORY" 'true',
               "teiid_rel:MATVIEW_TTL" 600000,
               "teiid_rel:MATVIEW_UPDATABLE" 'true', 
               "teiid_rel:MATVIEW_SCOPE" 'VDB')
               AS SELECT  A.ID, S.symbol, S.price, A.COMPANY_NAME FROM Stocks.StockPrices AS S, Accounts.PRODUCT AS A WHERE S.symbol = A.SYMBOL;
        ]]>
    </metadata>
</model>
